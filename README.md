# üçΩÔ∏è Meal Mastery - UI/UX Design

**Meal Mastery** is a thoughtfully crafted UI/UX design project for a modern mobile food recipe application, developed using Figma. This app is built to deliver a seamless, inspiring, and visually appealing user experience for cooking enthusiasts, home chefs, and anyone who enjoys discovering and organizing recipes.

The project focuses on simplicity, warmth, and functionality ‚Äî providing users with an intuitive way to browse, save, and submit recipes with clean navigation and attractive visuals. From welcoming users with engaging onboarding screens to allowing them to add personalized recipe content, Meal Mastery creates a cohesive and user-centered design journey from start to finish.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in creating end-to-end mobile interfaces, applying design principles such as consistency, hierarchy, accessibility, and aesthetic balance.




# üéØ Project Overview
The goal of this project was to design a complete mobile recipe application interface that could potentially be developed into a functional product. The app targets everyday users who seek inspiration in the kitchen and want to organize their favorite meals in one place.

The design process involved:

- **Crafting a consistent visual identity through color, typography, and layout**

- **Mapping user flows from onboarding to recipe discovery and contribution**

- **Ensuring an intuitive and responsive design that works across devices**

- **Enhancing usability with clean layouts and straightforward interactions**

Meal Mastery includes fully designed screens, each created with user goals in mind. The overall design is minimal yet vibrant, with a color palette that evokes warmth and creativity. Whether a user is a beginner or an experienced cook, the app ensures that finding, following, and sharing recipes is a delightful experience.

This UI/UX project highlights my ability to conceptualize a digital product from the user‚Äôs perspective and bring it to life through well-structured design components.
